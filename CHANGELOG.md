# Changelog

## v1.0.0-rc1

[breaking changes]
- `type/1` and `type!/1` functions now return the image types as 
atoms instead of `String.t()`. image_types = `:bmp | :gif | :jpeg | :png`
- `size/1` returns `{:ok, Fastimage.Dimensions.t()}` whereas 
before it returned `map()`. To achieve the same behaviour as before, now
`size!/1` is now available.
- `type/1` returns `{:ok, result}` whereas 
before it returned `result`. To achieve the same behaviour as before, now
`type!/1` is now available.
- add options to `type/2`, `size/2` and `info/2` as a second argument 
to allow manual overrides on the otherwise hard-coded values 
for `stream_timeout`, `max_redirect_retries` and `max_error_retries`

[changes]
- Separate the parser functions into their own module.
- Separate Stream into into own module and create a `%Stream.Acc{}` to
bring structured format to the stream processing entity.
- Simplify points of implementation of `Utils.close_stream/1`

[bug fixes]
- `close_stream` bug fixed where `:hackney` streams were not properly closed. 

[enhancements]
- Introduce `Fastimage.info/1` function that gets the type and size in a 
single streaming pass and return a `Fastimage` struct with various infos.
- Added ability to get size and type for binaries
- Added Fastimage.Error exception structs for improved error handling
- Improved readme
